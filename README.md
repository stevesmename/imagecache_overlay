Image Overlay (Adds Play Button Icon)
==================

Module adds a play button icon over images with Drupal imagecache.

User Problem:
Client needed way to upload video thumbnails to the site, when images were 
uploaded they did not have a play button and were desired to be added 
after the image was uploaded.

Solution:
This module (imagecache_overlay) for Drupal 7 solves the user problem story. With this module 
enabled the client can upload any image and when using the desired 'image style' the image will have a 
play button icon centered into the uploaded image.


Flexibility
==================
This module can be made flexible to overlay any type of image (beyond play button icon). To make 
this happen you can request this via an issue in GitHub or you can fork this project and modify the code.
